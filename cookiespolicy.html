COOKIE POLICY


<body>
    <br>
    This Cookie Policy (“Cookie Policy”) is a part of and incorporated within and is to be read along with the Privacy
    Policy (“Policy”) and Term of Use. The capitalized terms used in this Cookie Policy, but not defined herein, shall
    have
    the meaning given to such terms in the Privacy Policy.
    WHAT ARE COOKIES AND LOCAL STORAGE?
    Cookies are small text files that are placed on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and
    advertisements. There are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates the domain you are
    visiting are called “first party cookies.” So, cookies served by Nibble while you are on the Nibble Platform are
    first
    party cookies. Cookies served by companies that are not operating the domain you are visiting are called “third
    party
    cookies.” For eg., we may allow Google to set a cookie on your browser while you visit the Nibble Platform, and that
    would be a third party cookie. Cookies may also endure for different periods of time. “Session Cookies” only last
    only
    as long as your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are
    “persistent cookies” meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. For example, they may recognize your
    device
    when you re-open your browser and browse the internet again.
    “Pixel tags” (also called beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage, app, or
    advertisement which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including for example: device
    type,
    operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address, and other
    similar information, including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device. Pixels provide
    the
    means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and
    collect information about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner.
    Local storage is a technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your device.
    “Software Development Kits” (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile app
    context
    where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The primary app developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) from
    partners in the app, and thereby allow the partner to collect certain information about user interaction with the
    app
    and information about the user device and network information.
    WHY DO WE USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES?
    We use cookies and other identification technologies for various purposes, including: authenticating users, store
    information about you (including on your device or in your browser cache) and your use of our Services and the
    Nibble
    Platform, remembering user preferences and settings, determining the popularity of content, delivering and measuring
    the
    effectiveness of advertising campaigns, analyzing site traffic and trends, and generally understanding the online
    behaviours and interests of people who interact with our Services.
    DO WE USE THIRD PARTY COOKIES?
    We use a number of suppliers that may also set cookies on your device on our behalf when you visit the Nibble
    Platform
    to allow them to deliver the services they are providing.
    When you visit the Nibble Platform you may receive cookies from third party websites or domains. More information
    about
    these cookies may be available on the relevant third party’s website.
